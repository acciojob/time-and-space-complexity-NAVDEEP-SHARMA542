    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is by analyzing the amount of time it takes to run based on the input size. An algorithm with better Time complexity performs faster and is considered more efficient for large datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses while executing. For example, an algorithm with O(n) Space Complexity requires memory proportional to the input size.</p>
